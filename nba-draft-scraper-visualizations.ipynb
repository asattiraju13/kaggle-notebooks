I will compare numerical stats among players in drafts using graphs and visualization techniques and will also explore interesting relationships among the scraped data with different visualization techniques.\n\n### Tasks:\n\n1. From www.basketball-reference.com/draft, scrape the rookie stats of the top 10 overall picks of last 20 NBA drafts (2001 - 2020)\n2. Scrape data into a single Pandas MultiIndexDataFrame with outer index of draft year and inner index of pick number\n3. Run DataFrame manipulations and various visualization techniques to gain insight into questions regarding drafting teams, picks, and player stats.\n\n*** In this analysis, \"Drafting teams\" includes teams that trade for a pick. Drafting teams are teams that a rookie plays for for the entire season. Therefore, teams that trade or receive picks midway through the season will not be counted in this analysis.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Imports","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nfrom scipy import stats\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set_style('darkgrid')\n\n%matplotlib inline","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-19T19:57:33.168708Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-19T19:57:33.169127Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-19T19:57:33.771624Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-19T19:57:33.169026Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-19T19:57:33.770711Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Scraper Code and Processing","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Initialize dictionary and lists to be used in scraper\n\nplayer_data = {'team_id':[],'pos':[],'player':[],'mp_per_g':[],'efg_pct':[],\n               'pts_per_g':[],'trb_per_g':[],'ast_per_g':[],'ws':[],'bpm':[]}   #

The grouping of Big-Men has is located higher up on the trb_per_g axis than the others because they logically average more rebounds per game than other positions due to their height. The grouping of Guards is located farther out on the ast_per_g axis than the others because they are more responsible for distributing the ball to others, generating more assists than other positions. Notice that there is no clear grouping along the pts_per_g axis, as all three positions can score the ball depending on which position a certain team and offense emphasizes.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plot.write_html(\"3dscatter.html\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-19T20:07:28.360594Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-19T20:07:28.360923Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-19T20:07:28.407627Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-19T20:07:28.36089Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-19T20:07:28.406521Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### Let's explore this further ... using Linear Discriminant Analysis with all numeric data as our input and  new_pos as our class label.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis as lda\n\nX = temp.reset_index().drop(['year','pick','team_id','pos','player','new_pos',\n                             'efg_pct','mp_per_g','bpm','ws'],axis=1)   #LDA with PPG, RPG, APG as only input factors\ny = temp.new_pos\n\nlda_model = lda(n_components=2)\nnewX = lda_model.fit_transform(X.values,y)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-19T20:07:29.982393Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-19T20:07:29.982778Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-19T20:07:30.307093Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-19T20:07:29.98274Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-19T20:07:30.306055Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"lda_model.explained_variance_ratio_","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-19T20:07:33.135519Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-19T20:07:33.136323Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-19T20:07:33.143071Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-19T20:07:33.136277Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-19T20:07:33.142128Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the explained variance ratio, the X axis of the below plot explains 0.96% of the variance in the data; we could expect that the RPG and APG features are included in this axis as these features relatively clearly separated the position groupings on the interactive plot above.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.title('LDA graph with Position Groupings',fontdict={'fontsize':15})\nsns.scatterplot(x=newX[:,0],y=newX[:,1],hue=y)\nplt.savefig('ldascatter.png')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-19T20:07:35.257958Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-19T20:07:35.258372Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-19T20:07:35.746178Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-19T20:07:35.258339Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-19T20:07:35.745472Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This plot of Linear Discriminant Analysis with respect to the three position groupings listed on the graph attempt to plot the data points - which incorporated the features of PPG, RPG, and APG - along 2 axes to maximize separation between the position labels.

This could be due to a number of factors, such as the growth of another \"veteran\" player on the team, thus limiting a rookie's minutes, or the need to fill a void left by a star player's departure from the team, thus increasing a rookie's minutes. There are several reasons, each unique to the drafting team's circumstances. Of course, this could also depend upon the rookie's success throughout the season, which translates to the number of minutes played. \n\nFrom this barplot grid, we can see that Chicago, Cleveland, and Golden State have favored rookie guards and forwards in terms of minutes in the past 20 draft years. This makes sense, as Chicago drafted former MVP Derrick Rose, Cleveland drafted star Kyrie Irving, and Golden State drafted former MVP Stephen Curry. We also see that the minute distribution per position for Phoenix and Sacramento are fairly uniform, with rookie guards / forwards and centers having the most minutes in both cities. Minnesota seems to have favored centers more, drafting big-men such as star Karl Anthony-Towns. We could also propose explanations for the lack of minutes of some positions, making this visualization extremely versatile.","metadata":{}}]}
